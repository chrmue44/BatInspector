TODO
- GUI themes 
- progress bar for long running tasks
- help
- species comparison
- stop button to kill running script
- progess bar for WAV playing
- show queries like projects
- show summary
- bioacoustics dll is not suitable for parallel processing. one instance of fft object per thread would be needed (Task.CurrentId, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32253912/get-a-thread-id-inside-parallel-foreach-loop)

DONE
- start/stop playing wav works now thatns to Naudio
- query function: create query across multiple projects
- added button to add file(s) to project
- improved modal dialogs
- create project now works from wav folder OR project folder
- proper handling of modal dialogs
- write log to file when quitting program
- automatic reload of project after finishing species evaluation
- create prj from files has now a filter for start and end time
- more script commands
- improved help in filter definition window
- added calls per hour from 18:00 to 6:00 in summary report of each project
- reports and summary moved to individual sub folder for each model
- load location information for creating project from separate gpx file (not tested yet)
- wizard to create a project from a list of WAV files
- added summary report for each project
- integration of BatDetect2 model
- reports across projects (week, month year)
- move deleted files in sub folder del
- species prediction now done in worker thread
- removed rescaling option in frmStartPredict (because this must be done always, it is now an implicite operation during OPTION_CUT)
- Display of spectrum for single call can now be switched between logarithmic and linear scale
- rescaling is now applied to the intermediate call files, original recordings untouched
- enabled 2nd classifier
- update UI automatically after running a script
- mini tools to manipulate single file informations
- improved script management
- scatter diagrams
- new number format RT_TIME available in parser
- recording time now part of report file (filled out automatically from xml files if missing)
- added project information: Created, Notes (editable)
- improved WAV tool
- Project file compatible to Elekon FileVersion=3
- bugfix: rescale SamplingRate does not work for some files (save wav?)
- new script function: getFileName
- part of implementation sum report
- show cursors in spectrum and XT diagram as well
- using fftw3 dll instead of DSPlib (not finished yet)
- species list in project view is now location sensitive, it depends on location of first file in project
- Zoom View: Spectrum left side of waterfall 
- check consistency between report and prj file (in 20220610 are some...)
- backport of WavX bioacoustics package to C++ (no longer dependent on R!)
- bat species information moved from appSettings to separate file
- classifier Barataud
- offset between xt and ft image in zoom view eliminated
- tooltips in Zoom View in Ft, Xt and Spectrum
- additional mode "Cursor" for spectrum added
- added species information to zoom control
- script commands for getting infos about project files (untested)
- script commands FOR ... END, WHILE ... END
- script commands to work with CSV files
- icon and form to start and edit scripts
- scripting engine
- remove deleted files from report
- checkboxes in predict dialog are saved in settings
- option to cleanup temporary files after prediction
- added Fmin, Fmax to species data (and GUI)
- generate project file for directories filled with wavs (not coming from bat detector)
- button "show example" of bat species in zoom tab
- zoom amplitude in Xt view to maximum in observed interval (toggle via checkbox) 
- GUI fully multi language
- terminal (command line) to enter script commands
- start prediction with possibility to enabel/disable single steps
- classification of species with tensorflow classifier
- tool to inspect and manipulate wav files: can change sampling rate
- calculate distance to previous call and show it in zoom view
- tool to narrow down possible species by call parameters 
- Scrollbar in treeview for directory browser 
- select window type for FFT (in zoom window and saved to settings)
- frequency scale in spectrum on zoom view not accurate (seems to be ok)
- show file information (from xml-file) in zoom view
- multi language support:
- possibility to switch between logarithmic and linear scaling for waterfall diagram
- show data in directories without project files as well
- ask before closing programm, if user wantas to save his work
- specify threshold for probability to copy auto species to man species
- automatically zoom to call in zoom window
- Zoom window: one window side by side to main window
- alternatively (controllable per parameter in settings) Zoom window: as additional tab
- CtrlZoom as control
- settings window
- species information as parameter in settings
- find bug: apply filter after closing filter window -> crash
- spectrum for each call
- window to setup color gradient for waterfall diagrams
- set nodes to green when evaluation done
- add notes and approved species filed on the right side of ctlWavFile
- add mananual species selction
- training crickets
- about dialog
- playback of recordings
- Filter function
- Oscillogram in Zoom window
- excel like tab for report
- cursur up handling in main window
- find bug: delete after filter application (not everything gets deleted)
- Installer
