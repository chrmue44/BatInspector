TODO
- Show Freq, time, Amplitude on mouse over in zoom window (use Popup control)
- run R scripts
- GUI themes 

- help
- species comparison

- reports across projects (week, month year)
- 95% plausibility check
- find bug that deletes header from report
- more than one model
- prediction from call parameters (not wav)
- more script commands
- stop button to kill running script
- test script commands


DONE
- added species information to zoom control
- script commands for getting infos about project files (untested)
- script commands FOR ... END, WHILE ... END
- script commands to work with CSV files
- icon and form to start and edit scripts
- scripting engine
- remove deleted files from report
- checkboxes in predict dialog are saved in settings
- option to cleanup temporary files after prediction
- added Fmin, Fmax to species data (and GUI)
- generate project file for directories filled with wavs (not coming from bat detector)
- button "show example" of bat species in zoom tab
- zoom amplitude in Xt view to maximum in observed interval (toggle via checkbox) 
- GUI fully multi language
- terminal (command line) to enter script commands
- start prediction with possibility to enabel/disable single steps
- classification of species with tensorflow classifier
- tool to inspect and manipulate wav files: can change sampling rate
- calculate distance to previous call and show it in zoom view
- tool to narrow down possible species by call parameters 
- Scrollbar in treeview for directory browser 
- select window type for FFT (in zoom window and saved to settings)
- frequency scale in spectrum on zoom view not accurate (seems to be ok)
- show file information (from xml-file) in zoom view
- multi language support:
- possibility to switch between logarithmic and linear scaling for waterfall diagram
- show data in directories without project files as well
- ask before closing programm, if user wantas to save his work
- specify threshold for probability to copy auto species to man species
- automatically zoom to call in zoom window
- Zoom window: one window side by side to main window
- alternatively (controllable per parameter in settings) Zoom window: as additional tab
- CtrlZoom as control
- settings wndow
- species information as parameter in settings
- find bug: apply filter after closing filter window -> crash
- spectrum for each call
- window to setup color gradient for waterfall diagrams
- set nodes to green when evaluation done
- add notes and approved species filed on the right side of ctlWavFile
- add mananual species selction
- training crickets
- about dialog
- playback of recordings
- Filter function
- Oscillogram in Zoom window
- excel like tab for report
- cursur up handling in main window
- find bug: delete after filter application (not everything gets deleted)
- Installer
